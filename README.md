My portfolio of projects, old and new! These projects were created during my education. They're usually simple little games, but they mean a lot to me.

Tools used include Java and C++, two coding languages I used a lot in school.

Creating this portfolio has taught me how to build repositories in GitHub. This is a valuable skill for workers in the IT industry, as GitHub
is where we get to show off our work to interested parties. I think I'd like to add more to this in the future, perhaps some technical reports I
have worked on if I can find them!
